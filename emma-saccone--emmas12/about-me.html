            <p> Hello!<br />I am a student at Queens College currently working towards my bachelors degree in Graphic Design. I had never done any sort of art on the computer until I started this degree in Spring 2017. I have always enjoyed drawing with pencil or charcoal since I was a child, but wanted to try something different. I decided on graphic design since the world is very computer based. Besides drawing I enjoy going to concerts, watching movies, and reading when I have the time. <br /> <br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">  Education</span><br />
